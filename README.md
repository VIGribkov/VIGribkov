- 👋 Hi, I’m Vladimir Ivanivich Gribkov (@VIGribkov) from Siberia.
- 👀 I’m interested in python and machine learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning git, python, pandas, algorithms methods and many others.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate with anything since I am only hatching an idea 
how can mathematics and computer science serve to build a fair society 
that excludes exploitation in all spheres of life. My project is named 'communis_math'. 
- 📫 How to reach me: v.i.gribkov@mail.ru
